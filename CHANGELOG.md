## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-19 (Patch 2)

### Fixed
- **Camera visibility in popup** — `MenuData.cameras` refactored from `Vec<CameraEntity>` to `Vec<AppEntity>` with `"type":"camera"` in JSON serialization; cameras now render correctly in popup instead of being invisible
- **Entity registry resilience** — `HaEntityEntry.platform` changed from `String` to `Option<String>` to prevent deserialization failure when a single entity has `platform: null` in HA registry
- **Popup positioning drift (follow-up)** — `window_resize` now skips all operations if popup is hidden via `is_visible()` guard, eliminating 30s position drift caused by background JS resize calls; `reposition_from_tray` now uses deterministic `tray_pos` formula instead of reading `outer_pos.x`
- **Drag & drop rewrite** — Complete replacement of HTML5 Drag & Drop API with pointer events (`pointerdown/pointermove/pointerup`) via `setupPointerDrag` helper; WebView2 bug workaround: missing `user-select: none` on `.acc-row` caused text-selection drag to override element drag. Solution: full DnD API bypass with `setPointerCapture`, `elementFromPoint` with `pointerEvents: none`, 5px drag threshold
- **Detail panel background transparency** — Detail panel changed from `rgba(30,30,32,0.92)` (8% transparent) to `rgb(30,30,32)` (opaque); removed `backdrop-filter` from detail panel to prevent blur of internal content; new animation: slide + fade from right (14px translate) with spring easing

### Fixed (Build)
- **Build pipeline order** — `build-release.bat` corrected with proper sequence: 1) Vite build → 2) cargo build → 3) tauri bundle; previous order ran cargo before Vite, causing binary to embed old frontend and fail with "localhost refused connection"

---

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-17 (Patch)

### Fixed
- **Popup positioning drift** — popup no longer shifts right on repeated tray-icon clicks. Root cause: `window_resize` was calling `set_position` on the hidden window while JS continued running in background; `show_popup` now uses known logical width (300px × DPI scale) instead of `outer_size()` for stable X calculation.
- **Drag & drop areas in Settings** — dragstart guard `closest('.acc-drag')` incorrectly blocked all area drags (e.target is always the header div, never the span); removed the guard.
- **Drag & drop devices** — added `dragover` fallback on the entityList container so drops work even in gaps between rows.
- **Camera visibility** — cameras with `entity_category` set in HA registry were silently filtered; bypass this filter for the camera domain so all cameras always appear.
- **Tray icon right-click menu** — added "Impostazioni" and "Esci da ItsyHome" context menu items (right-click on tray icon).

### Added
- **Area hide/show button** — eye button on each area header in Settings > Accessories allows hiding/showing all entities in an area at once.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-16 (Initial Release)

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Migrated from Electron 33 to Tauri 2.0** — installer size reduced from ~180 MB to ~8 MB (22x smaller)
- Backend rewritten in **Rust** (tokio async, tokio-tungstenite WebSocket, reqwest HTTP)
- IPC layer migrated from Electron `contextBridge` / `ipcRenderer` to Tauri `invoke` / `listen`
- Bundler changed from `electron-vite` to **Vite 6**
- Persistence migrated from `electron-store` to `tauri-plugin-store`
- Autostart migrated from `app.setLoginItemSettings()` to `tauri-plugin-autostart`

### Added
- **Toast notifications** — visual feedback for every action (success and error)
- **Search / filter** (Ctrl+F or 🔍 button) — find any device in the popup by name
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Escape (close/back), Ctrl+F (open search)
- **Error reporting** — failed Home Assistant service calls shown as error toast
- Modular frontend architecture: `entities.ts` (per-domain card builders), `sections.ts` (section builders)
- Unified IPC adapter `src/lib/api.ts` — single source of truth for all backend calls

### Performance
| Metric | v1.x (Electron) | v2.0 (Tauri) | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Installer size | ~180 MB | ~8 MB | 22x smaller |
| RAM (idle) | ~120 MB | ~25 MB | 5x less |
| Cold startup | ~2 s | < 500 ms | 4x faster |

### Removed
- `electron`, `electron-vite`, `electron-builder`, `electron-store` (all replaced by Tauri stack)
- `src/main/` — Electron main process (replaced by `src-tauri/`)
- `src/preload/` — Electron preload scripts (not needed in Tauri)
- `electron.vite.config.ts`, `electron-builder.json`
